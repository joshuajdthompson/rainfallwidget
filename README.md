# Rainfall Widget 

## This simple widget queries the [monitor my watershed](https://monitormywatershed.org/) API to get the last 72-hrs of rainfall data.  The app the parses the xml file and creates a plotly rainfall plot.  A summary sentence below the app is then output. The widget can be accessed [here](https://wprp.shinyapps.io/rainfall_widget/).
